This simple utility for Linux reads through an entire raw filesystem
in order to  help the hard drive  controller ensure all  sectors are
readable and re-locate if needed those with higher error rates.

A simple read through helps with preventive maintenance.

This utility does'nt modify any data and trates the file system as
read-only raw device.

The  volume size is  not checked, execute with  drive name and volume
to read through.

Usage example:
 - sda  drive
 - 1000 go

sudo ./Drive_utilities sda 1000
